 # Static Members and `new.target` in ES6

## Static Methods

- Use the `static` keyword to define a static method on a class.
- Static methods are called on the class itself, not on instances.

```js
class Project {
  static getDefaultId() {
    return 0;
  }
}

console.log(Project.getDefaultId()); // 0

let p = new Project();
console.log(p.getDefaultId); // undefined (static methods are not available on instances)
```

## Static Properties

- In ES6, only static methods are supported in the class body.
- Static properties must be added directly to the class after its declaration:

```js
class Project {
  static getDefaultId() {
    return 0;
  }
}

Project.id = 99;
console.log(Project.id); // 99
```

- Attempting to declare a static property inside the class body (e.g., `static id = 0;`) results in a syntax error in ES6.

## Summary

- Use `static` for class-level methods.
- Static methods are called on the class, not instances.
- Add static properties directly to the class

## `new.target` in ES6

- `new.target` is a special meta-property available inside constructors.
- It refers to the constructor that was directly invoked with `new`.

### Basic Usage

```js
class Project {
  constructor() {
    console.log(typeof new.target); // "function"
    console.log(new.target);        // [class Project]
  }
}

let p = new Project();
// typeof new.target: "function"
// new.target: class Project
```

### Inheritance Example

```js
class Project {
  constructor() {
    console.log(new.target); // Points to the constructor actually called
  }
}

class SoftwareProject extends Project {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}

let sp = new SoftwareProject();
// new.target: class SoftwareProject
```

- When `super()` is called in a subclass, `new.target` in the parent constructor refers to the subclass constructor.

### Default Constructor

- If you don't define a constructor in the subclass, JavaScript creates a default one that passes all arguments to `super()` and sets `new.target` to the subclass.

### Practical Use

- `new.target` is useful for checking if a class is being instantiated directly or via inheritance.
- It can also be used to access static methods on the original class:

```js
class Project {
  constructor() {
    console.log(new.target.getDefaultId());
  }
}

class SoftwareProject extends Project {
  static getDefaultId() {
    return 99;
  }
}

let sp = new SoftwareProject(); // 99
```

- Here, `new.target` refers to `SoftwareProject`, so its static method is called.

## Summary

- `new.target` always points to the constructor that was originally called with `new`.
